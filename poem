- We went to the baseball game 
I hope my team doesnâ€™t lose because it would be a shame  
A player was up to bat 
But he struck out and everyone sat
A player hit a big home run 
and the ball went so high into the sun 
after the inning i got some ice cream 
I hope this team wins the game because it would be a dream
My team got 3 outs in the ninth inning 
and they ended up winning 
the fans went home happy 
but the players on the other team went home unhappy
